# Rails Blog Template

Creating a blog in Rails has a lot of parts that are repetitive like posts, users, authentication, links, admin dashboard, file upload, etc. I made this to use it as starting point to create a blog.

## Gems used

- bootstrap (design)
- devise (authentication)
- active_admin (admin panel)
- active_admin_flat_skin (admin panel design)
- carrierwave (file upload)
